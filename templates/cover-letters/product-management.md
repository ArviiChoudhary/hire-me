Dear [Company],

This letter is to express my interest in your posting for the PM intern role. I’m currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Science at Cornell Tech in New York City, having received a Bachelor’s in Computer Science prior.

With my past projects, I have received very good feedback on my work done using Sketch and Keynote for rapid prototyping and presentation designs. My background includes internships involving web design and development using HTML/CSS/JS as well as optimizing the UI for Unity applications.

Through this internship, I hope to gain a start in a PM career. Since I have experience with design and development already, I took the initiative this past fall by attending a part-time product management course in New York City through Product School. At 20, I was one of the youngest students they have ever accepted but given my experience, they decided to admit me. I have since graduated and gone on to read "Cracking the PM Interview" on my own. Ideally, this internship would lead to a full-time position at [INSERT COMPANY NAME HERE] afterward.

Cheers,
Frances

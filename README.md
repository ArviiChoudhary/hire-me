## Step 1 - Prepare

There are many free resources out there to prepare you for the technical interview:

### Websites

- [Coderbyte](http://coderbyte.com)
- [Interview Cake](http://www.interviewcake.com)
- [Interviewbit](http://www.interviewbit.com/profile/fvcproductions)
- [Interviewing.io](http://interviewing.io/)

### GitHub Repos

- [getting-a-gig](https://github.com/cassidoo/getting-a-gig)
- [interview](http://github.com/andreis/interview)

### Meetup Groups

Look up [Meetup groups](http://www.meetup.com) in your local area that are dedicated to preparing for coding interviews to practice with others.

## Step 2 - Search

Make a list of companies that you would love to work for and rank them by desire.

Research existing people at these companies that have your desired role and check out their personal websites, GitHub, and [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com) profiles to get a feel of what their background is.

Check if you know anyone working at that company already by checking their company page on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com).

Explore company reviews using [Glassdoor](http://glassdoor.com) - it's phenomenal for this sort of thing.

- [YCombinator Jobs](https://news.ycombinator.com/jobs)
- [ZipRecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/)

## Step 3 - Apply

Keep track of all the jobs you apply to using a platform like [Airtable](http://airtable.com) or [Google Sheets](http://sheets.google.com).

Use an online platform like [Creddle](http://creddle.io/) to avoid the tedious process of making a resume from scratch.

Use your connections to find someone you may know at the company (1st to 3rd connections on LinkedIn) to get a warm intro whenever possible. If you put yourself in the recruiter's shoes, you'll quickly realize that it would be way nicer to have referrals sent to you instead of looking over hundreds (or thousands) of resumes.

## Step 4 - Interview

So a recruiter reached out and wants to interview. Congrats! 🎉

Make sure to maintain a checklist to get ready for the interview, introduce yourself in an intriguing way, know the answers to some behavioral/experience questions they may ask, and **always always** ask questions!

## Step 5 - Accept

Create a minimum salary target for every company and change accordingly based on job type.

I would recommend asking for a better salary from companies you feel you could get offers for but don't necessarily want to work for.

Only focus on `base salary` when considering offers. Many companies like to offer the total package number first which includes bonuses and other benefits.

Realize both your salary and bonuses offered are going to go through taxes, so take that into account.

To really learn how to negotiate your salary, I would check out the book [Fearless Salary Negotiation](http://fearlesssalarynegotiation.com/). Here's [a great overview of the book](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2016/06/03/kalzumeus-podcast-episode-12-salary-negotiation-with-josh-doody/) if you don't want to buy it.

## Installation

I'm using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) as my static site generator to showcase all the resources in this repo.

To get this up and running locally, type in the following commands.

```bash
# It is recommended to install docsify-cli globally, which helps initializing and previewing the website locally.

npm i docsify-cli -g

# Run the local server with docsify serve. You can preview the site in your browser on http://localhost:3000.

docsify serve docs
```

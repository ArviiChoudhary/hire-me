## Resume

Make a list of companies that you would love to work for and rank them by desire.

> For example

Rank | Company
---|---
1  | Apple
2  | Google
...| ...
10 | Yahoo

## Salary

Create a minimum salary target for every company and change accordingly based on job type.

Recommend asking for better salary from companies you feel you could offers for but don't necessarily want to work for.

Only focus on `base salary`.

Many companies like to offer the total package number first which includes bonuses and other benefits.

Realize both your salary and bonuses offered are going to go through taxes, so take that into account.

> For example

Rank | Company | Type | Min. Base Salary
---|---|---|---
1  | Apple | Full-Time | $100K/year
2  | Google | Part-Time | $50/hour

## Step 1 - Prepare

There are many free resources out there to prepare you for the technical interview:

- [Coderbyte](http://coderbyte.com)
- [Interview Cake](http://www.interviewcake.com)
- [Interviewbit](http://www.interviewbit.com/profile/fvcproductions)
- [Interviewing.io](http://interviewing.io/)

### GitHub Repos

- [code-problems](https://github.com/blakeembrey/code-problems)
- [getting-a-gig](https://github.com/cassidoo/getting-a-gig)
- [interview](http://github.com/andreis/interview)

Look up [Meetup groups](http://www.meetup.com) in your local area that are dedicated to preparing for coding interviews to practice with others

## Step 2 - Search

Make a list of companies that you would love to work for and rank them by desire.

Research existing people at these companies that have your desired role and check out their personal websites, GitHub, and [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com) profiles to get a feel of what their background is.

Check if you know anyone working at that company already by checking their company page on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com).

Explore company reviews using [Glassdoor](http://glassdoor.com) - it's phenomenal for this sort of thing.

## Step 3 - Apply

Keep track of all the jobs you apply to using a platform like [Airtable](http://airtable.com) or [Google Sheets](http://sheets.google.com).

Use an online platform like [Creddle](http://creddle.io/) to avoid the tedious process of making a resume from scratch.

## Step 4 - Accept

Create a minimum salary target for every company and change accordingly based on job type.

Recommend asking for better salary from companies you feel you could offers for but don't necessarily want to work for.

Only focus on `base salary`.

Many companies like to offer the total package number first which includes bonuses and other benefits.

Realize both your salary and bonuses offered are going to go through taxes, so take that into account.

To really learn how to negotiate your salary, check out the book [Fearless Salary Negotiation](http://fearlesssalarynegotiation.com/). Here's [a great overview of the book](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2016/06/03/kalzumeus-podcast-episode-12-salary-negotiation-with-josh-doody/) if you don't want to buy it.

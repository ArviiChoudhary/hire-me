I attended my first Meetup for the Norfolk.js group exactly 2 years ago, in December of 2014 (https://fvcproductions.com/2014/12/23/first-meetup-first-impressions/).

Since then, I have attended numerous Meetup events and have even gone on to speak at a Meetup event myself at that same group in January of this year .

In other words, I have thoroughly enjoyed being a part of Meetup's product journey and I'm taking my chances at a crazy cool opportunity to try and become part of that myself.

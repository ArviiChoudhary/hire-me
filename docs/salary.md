# Salary Negotiation

I would prefer to focus on the value I can add to this company rather than what I’m paid at my current job.

I don’t have a specific number in mind for a desired salary, and you know better than I do what value my skill set and experience could bring to your company.

I want this move to be a big step forward for me in terms of both responsibility and compensation.

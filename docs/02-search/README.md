# Step 2 - Search {docsify-ignore}

Make a list of companies that you would love to work for and rank them by desire.

Research existing people at these companies that have your desired role and check out their personal websites, GitHub, and [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com) profiles to get a feel of what their background is.

Check if you know anyone working at that company already by checking their company page on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com).

Explore company reviews using [Glassdoor](http://glassdoor.com) - it's phenomenal for this sort of thing.

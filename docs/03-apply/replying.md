# Replying to Recruiters

> Okay, so you got a recruiter to reach out to you. That's great!
>
> Now you got to make sure to reply back to them in a timely manner.
>
> One of the first questions you'll get from them of course is when you're available to talk/video chat/whatever.
>
> I personally use [Calendly](http://calendly.com) for this process and it works wonders. I'd recommend trying it out yourself since it's free.

Either way, here's a template to get you started.

Hi [Name of Recruiter],

Thanks for reaching out! I'm very excited to learn more about [company].

So in terms of setting up a time, I actually have a [Calendly](http://calendly.com/fvcproductions) where you're more than welcome to see which times I'll be available and make an appointment.

Here are a few times that would work for me this week and next.

- Friday - March 17 - anytime after 1 pm
- Monday - March 20 - anytime after 1 pm
- Wednesday - March 22 - anytime after 10 am

Thanks again for reaching out and I look forward to hearing back!

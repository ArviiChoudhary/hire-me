# Replying to Recruiters

## Scheduling

One of the first questions you'll get from them of course is when you're available to talk/video chat/whatever.

I personally use [Calendly](http://calendly.com) for this process and it works wonders.

I'd recommend trying it out yourself since it's free.

## Email Template

Here's a reply template you can use to follow up.

```markdown
Hi [Name of Recruiter],

Thanks for reaching out! I'm very excited to learn more about [company].

So in terms of setting up a time, I actually have a [Calendly](https://calendly.com/fvcproductions) where you're more than welcome to see which times I'll be available and make an appointment.

Thanks again for reaching out and I look forward to hearing back!

# Step 3 - Apply {docsify-ignore}

Keep track of all the jobs you apply to using a platform like [Airtable](http://airtable.com) or [Google Sheets](http://sheets.google.com).

Use an online platform like [Creddle](http://creddle.io/) to avoid the tedious process of making a resume from scratch.

Use your connections to find someone you may know at the company (1st to 3rd connections on LinkedIn) to get a warm intro whenever possible. If you put yourself in the recruiter's shoes, you'll quickly realize that it would be way nicer to have referrals sent to you instead of looking over hundreds (or thousands) of resumes.

# Online Presence

> Some companies ask for links to your projects or online profiles to verify you have relevant experience and to check whether or not you are active in your field.
>
> Meaning you should invest at least some time in [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com), [GitHub](http://github.com/fvcproductions), and other sites you feel are relevant.
>
> These are the sites I get asked for a lot or personally provide myself since I think they showcase my work off well.

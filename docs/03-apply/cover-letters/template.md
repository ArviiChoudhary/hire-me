Hi [recruiter you met],

Iâ€™m [your name]. It was a real pleasure chatting with you at the rooftop mixer at [company name] last weekend. I found your contact info on LinkedIn, and it turns out we both know [mutual friend], a friend of mine from working at [past company] last summer.

I am a huge fan of the [company] app and I especially love the [insert aspect of the app] and the culture there. I worked on similar projects before which you can check out here: [insert portfolio link]. Based off my previous experience, [talk about how previous experience relates to this role].

I've actually created this [project description] that uses [company tech stack] which ideally can showcase my relevant skill set.

Would you be interested in meeting up to chat further? I am currently located in San Francisco, where your company is headquartered.

Best,

[your name]
[contact info]

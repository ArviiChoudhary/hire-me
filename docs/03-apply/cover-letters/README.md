# Cover Letters {docsify-ignore}

> Cover letters can be quite annoying since many recruiters tend to not read them but for the companies that **require** one, creating a relevant cover letter is vital could lead to a much better response.

> Also, cover letters can serve as ideal cold emails if you're trying to reach out to a recruiter you met in person.

## Tips

- Don't regurgitate your resume
- Mention a specific thing that appeals to you about working for that specific company
- The first paragraph should directly state what position you're applying for
- If you know someone at the company, now would be the time to mention them.
- Share an idea you have that you think would be valuable for the company or even try to provide some help/criticism (I noticed a bug on your website...)
- Make sure it's less than one page.
- Share experiences that demonstrate how prepared you are for the job.
- Provide relevant contact info (GitHub, LinkedIn, phone #, email, etc.)

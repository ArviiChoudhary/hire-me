# **Cover Letter**** Tips**

* **Don’t regurgitate your resume** - specify why you/your skills make you a good fit for *this* *specific* company. Cover letters should be customized for each job description.
* **First paragraph should directly state what position you are applying for**: Recruiters will stop reading if they aren’t engaged in the first paragraph
* **Show you’ve researched the company** - mention why you are interested in them: maybe you have used their product, read recent news story or articles on them, heard a speech or had conversation with an employee ([_examples here_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zR20SnCzDg4J7kC2Olk7eSr4UjXP59-ZQVH3ycU5dmQ/edit)). This shows that you’ve put thought and consideration into why you are applying instead of applying on a whim.
* **ALWAYS mention that you know/spoke with someone at the company, if you did**
* **Humble brag **- mention how some of your past experiences/successes have prepared you to contribute to their team. Use numbers when applicable (users, downloads etc).
* **Growth mindset** - mentions how you hope to learn and grow in the role. Be specific. This communicates your potential to adapt in the position.
* **Share ideas (if it’s a top choice company or startup)** - see templates below
* **End with a follow-up ask** - ask “what’s the next step in the application process” or “ what can I do to further my application?”. Reiterate your phone number and email.
* **One page max**
* **Saved as PDF and attach to initial emails you send them**
* **Naming convention for file, simple and clear: **“[SusanNesbit] Resume 2016”
* **Share experiences that demonstrate how you are prepared for the job** - you’ve used their technology, you’ve done similar work in the past, you have used their product

**Susan’s cover letter for Make School**

SUBJECT :Interest: Head of Business Development opening (Susan Nesbitt)

Hi Make School,

My name is Susan Nesbitt.  I'm a friend and former Girls Who Code colleague of Carolina Huaranca's over at Kapor Capital.  I met with her the other day and she quickly suggested I connect with you (Jeremy and Ashu specifically) about your open Business Development role.

I love the thesis Make School is setting out to prove...A 2-year college replacement program for founders and developers is a viable option to a traditional 4-year college education for many.  Amen!

My background lies at the intersection of Silicon Valley product development (Yahoo! & SNOCAP), running a world-class nonprofit (Craigslist Foundation) and raising $10m this past year for Girls Who Code from hundred's of Fortune 500 corporate and philanthropy leaders across the country.

At this point in my career, I am squarely focused helping to further technology education at scale and change the face of the next generation's workplace through parity and diversity initiatives that level the playing field for everyone around the world.

I'd love to meet with you and discuss how I might be able to advance Make School's efforts and see if there is a mutual fit.

I am available to meet via phone, video or in-person at your convenience.  My current CV is attached.

Best,

Susan

Dear OcuSpec founders:

I am eagerly applying for a software engineering position at OcuSpec, and I am excited to contribute my experience, skills, and ideas to help OcuSpec develop motion control and 3D sensing technology. These three reasons explain why I am the talented engineer you are seeking:

**I love puzzles.** I have a penchant for problem-solving and I love to unravel mysteries. I often turn everyday occurrences into puzzles – like how to find the largest tree in a forest. My background in mathematics is strong, so I can quickly analyze algorithms to find better solutions. I have 8 years of experience programming in Java, so I naturally think in an object-oriented style. With this mindset, using objects was habit when I wrote a file system from scratch in C++ and developed a Dominoes game with AI player strategies in Java. I also have a deep love for Python, which I used to process a corpus of political discourse and generate new speeches. My analytical skills and programming expertise serve as my fork and knife when I devour new puzzles.

**I communicate effectively. **I have refined my communication skills through lecturing in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence courses as well as teaching Olympiad-style problem-solving at AwesomeMath summer camp. Students have often told me that I am skilled at explaining complex ideas clearly and precisely. I have also been a member of Toastmasters, a public speaking club, for over a year and have given four speeches in that time period. For this reason, my research advisor asked me to present our paper at last year’s conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. My communication and writing skills make me prepared to interact with developers, marketers, and other early-adopters of OcuSpec’s new technology.

**I work well in a team. **I have led software development teams of 3 to 6 people and coordinated math camps with 35 staff members. For my research, I interviewed 30 applicants, selected 6 as essay annotators, and supervised their adherence to the rubric I designed. Through working with diverse groups, I have learned how to delegate responsibilities, facilitate meetings, guide a group to reach consensus, and resolve conflicts. In addition, when I face a new situation, my shrewdness and careful attention to detail allow me to learn the skills I need to succeed very quickly, and I continue to hone those skills over time. People enjoy working with me, as a leader and as a peer, because I am perceptive, responsible, and sociable.

I have included my resume, which details my education, experience, and skills that demonstrate my qualifications. I would appreciate the opportunity further discuss my interest in joining OcuSpec, to learn more about the company, and to answer any questions you may have regarding my resume. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you to schedule an interview.

Sincerely, Alan Davis

I appreciate you taking the time to read this! Here are some awesome reasons why you should consider me for a position at Product Hunt:

* **I write high quality code:** Recall: Social Journaling is my most recent project, and you can find it on the App Store, [**_recall-that.com_**](http://recall-that.com/), or my github ([_github.com/joshuarcher_](http://github.com/joshuarcher)).  I’m confident in languages such as Swift, Python, and Ruby on Rails while I also have experience writing C++ and and a little bit of Javascript.
* **I’m a Product Hunt power user as I use it 10+ times a day **
* [Image: file:///-/blob/ZZRAAAUMYKO/-UPkLewffX2eC7S-mQ9a9g]
* **:** My friends and peers used to tease me about how much I use Product Hunt that I now remove the referer URL, ‘/?ref=producthunt’, when I share links with them :).  Whether it’s contributing feedback to the public slack community about the most recent beta, using it on web or iOS, I love being apart of the Product Hunt community.
* **I want to support your vision, and I have ideas for the site:** I’ve been thinking deeply about the curation and community building problem you all have been solving, and one idea I have would increase user-user engagement.  To build more interactions between users Product Hunt could suggest users and user-curated collections to follow based on product likes, comments, and even the topics they’ve interacted with.
* **I can intern for at least 6 months, if not work longer: **I’m truly a team player and love working with other people who follow the same vision.  I’m fully motivated by what I’m working on and would eat, sleep, and breath the Product Hunt dream.  I’ve worked in a classroom setting with Dan Morse, and he could advocate on my behalf. I’d love to give you references from my instructors at Make School or friends in the workforce who could back up my talent and work ethic.

Thanks again for taking the time to read this! I look forward to exploring this with you, or at least treating you to coffee.

Best,

Josh Archer

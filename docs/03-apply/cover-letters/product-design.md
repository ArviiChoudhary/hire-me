I was introduced via a16z to the software engineering position for Everlaw but as of right now, Iâ€™m looking for roles that focus more on design than just purely development since that intersection aligns more with my future career path. This position seems more of a fit.

I have received very good feedback on my work done with Sketch and Keynote for rapid prototyping and presentation designs. My background includes internships primarily involving product design and development using HTML/CSS/JS or Unity.

While I have no formal design education, I've given a talk on web design several times at tech events and have taken an online course in web design through Designlab.

I would encourage you to view some of this work on my Speaker Deck at http://speakerdeck.com/fvcproductions or through my portfolio at http://fvcproductions.com/portfolio.

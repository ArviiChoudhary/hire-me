## Research

### Company Website

- Familiarize yourself with their tech stack.
- Check out their company culture page.
- Read their “About Us” page.
- Familiarize yourself with their team page.
    + What are they wearing? Casual, business casual or formal?

### Glassdoor­

- Skim over company reviews.
    + Note if anything extremely positive or negative comes up consistently.
- Read through the relevant interview experiences.
    + It's easy to filter by specific position and get a lot of potential interview questions the company will actually ask you.

### Crunchbase

- How many rounds of funding has the company had so far? From who?
- How many people work there?
- Who's part of the leadership team (CEO, CTO, etc.)?
    + Do they have a good reputation?

### LinkedIn

- Check out the people who you will be interviewing with.
- Look at the extra information posted on the company page.
- Follow the company if you're so inclined.

### Google

- Are they in the news?
    + What's the latest?
    + Any red flags?

## Day Before

- Review your resume.
- Prepare and write down questions to ask the company.
    + I'd recommend having some kind of structure to how you do this since you may end up interviewing with a crap ton of companies.

> On Site Interviews

- Check to make sure you're ready to go in terms of transportation and arriving on time.
- Pick a decent outfit based off what you've learned on company culture.
    + Business casual is usually the safe option here.
- Get some damn sleep. No one wants to interview a zombie.

## Day Of

- Eat some food beforehand, you don't want your interviewers to hear your tummy growling.
- Call someone you like a lot and talk to them so you're not as nervous beforehand and you remember what it's like to communicate with another human.
- Pop a breath mint in.
- Put your cell on "Do Not Disturb" mode.
- Ask some damn good and relevant questions.
    + If you're that one person who says they don't have any questions, that's a huge turn-off to recruiters.
- Eye contact and body language are important. Present yourself as open and confident.
- No slouching.

## Day After

- Send a thank you email to your recruiter and interviewers if possible.

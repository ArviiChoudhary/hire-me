## Meetup Groups

Look up [Meetup groups](http://www.meetup.com) in your local area that are dedicated to preparing for coding interviews to practice with others.

For example, these are Meetup groups in the NYC area that focus on interview prep.

## [Outco.co](https://outco.io/)

This is essentially a coding bootcamp but for getting a job. So it's a job bootcamp for engineers. You spend a full month dedicated to learning how to master the data structures/algorithms tech interview, negotiate your salary, and apply to jobs.

It looks very promising but keep in mind that the program does cost $4.5K if you go with the upfront tuition option (as of May 2017). Another option is paying $0 upfront but then 8% of your starting salary.
